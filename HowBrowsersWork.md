# How-browsers-work
Browsers are software applications used in the access of the interent. There are a number of actions 
that a browser performs in order to display or access the data requested for by the client. Usually,
the broswer sends a request to a server in order for the server to evaluate that request and respond
compprehensively.

#How it works-steps
By typing the (URL), the browser is able to connect to the Domain Name System where all the URLs are
listed as well as their corresponding IP Addresses. The IP Address in this case acts as a unique identifier
for a particular browser. When the web server is contacted it looks up whatever page the browser is asking 
for and gives it to the browser.

#The step by step process
1) Your browser contacts the Domain Name System and asks for an IP Address for the URL you typed in.     
2) The Domain Name System gives the browser the IP Address, and your browser goes to that address.       
3) Your browser requests the web page you want, and the web server at the IP Address gives that page to the 
browser.
